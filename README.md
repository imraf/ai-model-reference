# 🧠 Gen AI Model Reference

Welcome to the **Gen AI Model Reference** repository — a resource for AI Engineers looking to understand and compare real-world hardware requirements for running generative AI models.

## 📘 What Is This?

This repository powers the [AI Model Reference website](https://imraf.github.io/ai-model-reference), which serves as a curated reference for AI models. It includes:

- Static **web pages** (for GitHub Pages)
- **CSV data** files containing model hardware requirements  
  ➤ These are also accessible from the website interface.

## ⚙️ Real-World Requirements

The goal is to reflect **real, tested hardware requirements** — not theoretical or estimated specs.

**Please ensure any data you submit is verified**, meaning it’s tested on actual hardware by monitoring VRAM usage during model operation.

## 🙏 Credits

- The initial batch of data was recorded from model cards on HuggingFace, measured by myself and scraped from the project **[Can I Run This LLM?](http://www.canirunthisllm.net/)**, which (at the time of writing) is no longer available.
